# avianAcoustics is pretty cool

A simple site utilizing React + Node/Express.<br>
It is just a showcase of a few albums that I enjoy listening to. It was originally going to include audio gear,speakers, etc, but I found it to be pointless since who is going to take the time to look through all of that?. <br>
The site also makes use of Google ReCaptcha to verify the user's humanity, allows users to comment using google sign on, and includes a mobile friendly UI.<br>
See it in action [here](https://avianacoustics-backend.onrender.com).(May take a while if site has not been accessed in a while)
